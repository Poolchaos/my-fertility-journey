# My Fertility Journey - Assessment

This document provides an overview of the time spent on the assessment, incomplete functionality, known issues, and challenges faced during the process.

---

## a. Time Spent (Man Hours)

- **Total Time:** ~22 hours, including significant time spent learning React Native.

---

## b. Incomplete Functionality and Known Issues

The following functionalities were not fully completed or have known issues:

### **Styling:**

- **Inline Styles to Tailwind:** Not all inline styles have been converted to Tailwind classes.
- **Sidebar Width Jump:** The sidebar width shifts unexpectedly on initial load and requires further debugging.
- **Tailwind `boxShadow` Issues:** The `boxShadow` settings in `tailwind.config.js` are not behaving as expected in the `tailwind-rn` script.
- **CSS Variables:** Due to React Native’s lack of CSS variable support, workarounds were used with `styles/styles.js`, but a more scalable solution is needed.
- **Fine-Tuning Spacing & Colors:** Additional refinements to colors, sizes, padding, and margins are required.

### **Functionality Issues:**

- **Profile Button Navigation:** The profile button does not currently navigate to the profile page or highlight the active state.
- **Mocking HTTP Requests:** While mock API data is integrated, the full pipeline that simulates an actual HTTP call resolving mock data (instead of importing directly from a constants file) is not fully implemented.
- **SVG Implementation:** The proper implementation of SVGs via `react-native-svg` is pending.

### **Testing:**

- **Mobile Testing:** Limited testing was conducted on physical devices; focus was on web-based development.
- **Unit Test Coverage:** Some components (e.g., `Navbar`) have tests, but broader coverage is needed across other components.
- **React Native Table Component Issue:** There is an unresolved issue related to `react-native-table-component`.

### **Future Considerations:**

- **Performance Optimizations:** Optimization of asset loading and state management could improve app efficiency.
- **Bundling/Hosting:** Future work could explore deployment solutions.

## c. Challenges

The most challenging aspects of the assessment were:

### **1. Tailwind CSS & React Native Integration**

- React Native’s styling approach differs significantly from standard TailwindCSS, requiring `tailwind-rn`, which posed some challenges.
- The `boxShadow` issue required debugging but remains unresolved.

### **2. Handling of CSS Variables**

- CSS variables are unsupported in React Native, leading to workaround solutions that are not ideal for long-term maintainability.

### **3. Unit Testing & Mocking**

- Mocking dependencies in Jest, especially with context providers and third-party libraries (`@expo/vector-icons`), was complex.
- Mocking API calls fully (simulating HTTP resolution instead of direct imports) is incomplete.
- Ensuring proper test coverage while dealing with component re-renders and UI changes required extra attention.
